I asked chatGPT to create a simply linked list in C. It Worked!

He generated an example and this idea of having an assistant to generating code 
seems very nice, especially for C. 

However, the result was an educational-style code without proper error handling.

So it's pretty cool to learn, but if I want to use this code in production what 
guarantee do I have?

Thinking about this problem I decided to create this repository with reliable and 
production quality source code for data structures and algorithms. In the future
I want a web tool to guide the user and produce the code automatically.

A this point samples will be make using a representative types for structs, strings,
int and the programmer will have to replace the code for it's current type.
