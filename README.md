I asked chatGPT to create a simply linked list in C. It Worked!
He generated an example and this idea of having an assistant to generating code looked good.

However, the result was an educational-style code without proper error handling.

So it's pretty cool to learn, but if I want to use this code in production what 
is the guarantee?

Thinking about this problem I decided to create this repository with reliable and 
production quality source code.
